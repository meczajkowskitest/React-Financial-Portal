# React Financial Portal

## A Fun Journey into React Development

Welcome to Your React Adventure!

Hey there, future React wizard! Get ready to embark on a fun and exciting journey where you'll build a web portal for managing financial accounts. This project is designed to help you showcase your skills and creativity in a stress-free environment. So, grab your favorite beverage, put on your thinking cap, and let's dive into the world of React!

Throughout this project, you'll tackle real-world scenarios that a Junior React Developer might face in the finance industry. You'll have the chance to demonstrate your technical prowess, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail. Remember, this is not just a test; it's an opportunity to shine and show what you're capable of!

A repository will be generated for you, so you can focus on writing clean and efficient code. As you progress through the tasks, you'll move them from **BACKLOG** to **IN PROGRESS**, then to **IN REVIEW**, and finally to **DONE** once you've incorporated feedback. This flow will help you stay organized and showcase your ability to manage a project effectively.

So, are you ready to take on this challenge and prove your React skills? Let's get started and make some magic happen!
